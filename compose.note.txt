Note: Compose in next lesson

Hello everyone! In the next lesson, we are going to use a method called compose that we import from
'react-apollo'. Unfortunately with the recent React-Apollo update to v3.0.0 it's been removed from
React-Apollo and is no longer something we can import from this library. Luckily compose was just a
copy of lodash's flowRight. Lodash is just a small library that gives us access to a bunch of helper
functions, of which flowRight is one of! In the following lesson, anyplace you see compose just use
lodash flowRight!

You can install lodash in your project by adding it as a dependency as follows:

If you're using yarn:

yarn add lodash

If you're using npm:

npm install lodash

You can then import flowRight into your file like so:


import { flowRight } from 'lodash';
and just replace any place in the lesson where we use compose with flowRight:

export default compose(
  //...code 
)(CollectionItemContainer);
becomes

export default flowRight(
  // ...code
)(CollectionItemContainer);



You can find out more about this breaking change here as well: https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/issues/3330. So push forward with the lesson :)
